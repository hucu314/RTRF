1st Sprint:
	Finished the player animations and basic movement. I also started working on the mechanics for the boat. I still need to create combat mechanics for the player, but other than I got a lot of things completed. There is a little bit of lack of communication, but other than that the team is doing good. 
2nd Sprint:
	Finished boat mechanics and ability to switch between player and boat. I also created different types of boats. All that is needed is to implement a system to upgrade the boat. There is some noticable lack of work on the project from the other team members, but other than that everything is going fine.
3rd Sprint:
	There is now a very big noticable decline in work. I'm trying my best to get as many easy points as possible, but the game will definitely be a little bare when compared to the original concept of the game.

Individually I felt really good about my contribution to the project. I was able to do things mostly by myself which I felt great about. At the same time, I learned about features of Godot to make things that I didn't know where possible. I was able to learn about all the different capabilities of Godot. Some suprises I ecountered were problems with things not interacting with each other. This led me to learn more about collisions and layers which helped greatly. Some difficulties that I ecountered were some organization problems as well as team problems. If I were to do it again, I would try to be more organized and try to help my teammates to focus more on the project. Overall, it was very fun to make this game.
